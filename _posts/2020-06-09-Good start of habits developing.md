# Good start of habits developing

### About writing. Try to stick to writing for 3 hours a day. 

After the recent experience of writing funds, I feel that writing is the result of the absorption of many things after reading and input, and the output of ideas after sublimation. Writing is a process of expressing one's minds, and one can pass one's thoughts to others through writing. The best way for scientific researchers to pass on their research to others is to write. Therefore, I put writing first.

### About work and rest. Go to bed at 10 pm and start at 6 am. 

Many studies have proved that people who go to bed early and get up early are more likely to be energetic and focus on their work. Of course, there may be people who like to work at night, but after a period of practice,  I find I am more suitable for going to bed early and getting up early. This will make me feel better in my day.

### About concentration and procrastination. Do only one task at a time, respect the 72-hour principle.

It may be possible to process several things in parallel while working. The disadvantage is that it is difficult to concentrate. It is difficult to complete one of the things at a time, causing a delay, and the delay will lead a negative psychological/emotional feedback so that the delay becomes a vicious circle. Many studies have proved that it is more efficient to concentrate on one thing at a time. Try to minimize other things that may have an impact on concentration when you are working (e.g., emails, mobile phones, other apps). You must learn to delay of gratification. Don’t start doing other things when you are up to one. The noises that are raising in your mind sometimes usually interrupts what is doing.

### About doing sports. Run for 1 hour per day.

Exercise can keep the body in good shape and state, and running can train your concentration. I have developed the habit of running 10 kilometers per day. I used to like to run in the afternoon or at night. To spend more time reading at night, I decided to change this habit to run for 1 hour in the morning.

### About reading and skincare. Read 1 hour a day.

People who do scientific research, especially those who have reached a Ph.D. level in a field, are very focused in one field. That is, focusing on a certain field will make them ignore the knowledge of other fields. An hour of books reading keeps you constantly updated with fresh knowledge. Keep reading one book and change it to another book. Cultivate the habit of accomplishing one thing, complete a paper and start writing another one, and finish reading one book and then start reading another book.

### About coffee. One cup of coffee per day. No more refreshing drinks in the afternoon.

A proper drink in the morning can make you feel awake, but too much coffee. On the contrary, it is not very good for the body, so you can have a drink in the morning and stop drinking refreshing drinks after 2 pm.
